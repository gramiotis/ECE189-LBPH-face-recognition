# LBPH-Facial Recognition
This was a project for ECE-189 university class. This projects implements a 
very basic facial recognition program based on the LBPH algorithm.

## Dependencies
The dependencies that need to be installed for the program to work
properly are:
* OpenCV
* Numpy

## How it works
The program is able to recognize faces only stored in the database folder.
First, the user must register a face that is saved in the database folder
locally by following the instructions on the terminal. Then, to recognize a 
face, a single picture is taken and the result of the algorithm is displayed 
alongside a confidence probability.
